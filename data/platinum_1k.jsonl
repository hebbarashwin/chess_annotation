If thebishop took the pawn, that would be check, with no real option to do anythingother than move the king out of check, which in turn would block somethingelse off. If the knight were to make the attack, then that would allowa later move to either take the queen or the rook. When it comes to a situationof which to take, it is best to remember which is tactically better tobe taken with as little loss as possible. For Example, if it came to thebit, yes, the queen could be taken at the loss of the knight. However,the rook could be taken for essentially free.

Black is allowed his bit of fun, but the queen is ambushed behind the rook, and White can trump Black by meeting his discovered checks with discovered mates! The threat is 2 Re3 mate, and the queen move prepares to meet 1...Ke4 by 2 Qg2 mate. Black can stop the threat by 1...d3, but then 2 Rb4 is mate, while 1...e4 is answered by 2 Rb5 mate. The two star variations arise from the other moves of Black's king, 1...Kc4+ allows 2 Rf3 mate (the rook must guard d3), and 1...Ke6+ allows 2 Rb7 mate (the rook must guard d7 and e7).

With an open f-file the rook can then target Black's vulnerable f7-square. Meanwhile White's pawn at f4 assails Black's pawn at e5. If Black deals with the threat by taking the threatener (2... e5xf4), White plans to play d2-d4, establishing a classical pawn duo in the center. But after 2... e5xf4 White shouldn't move the queen-pawn up immediately (3. d2-d4) because Black would then have a venomous queen check at h4. This would be unsatisfactory news for White's king.

With Black having whatis clearly a bad bishop, obstructed by its own pawns, Petrosian actuallyexchanges it off! It might seem as though he has taken leave of his senses,but in fact, of course, it is an exceptionally deep decision. The mostobvious way for White to play this position is to exchange rooks, and bishopfor knight, and so aim to reach an ending with knight versus the 'bad bishop'.Let us assume that Black cooperates fully in allowing this: 18. Rxd8 Rxd819. Rd1 lRxd1+ 20. Kxd1 h6 (Black could of course move his knight to c8,to avoid the further exchange, but we will assume he 'comes quietly') 21.Bxb6+ Kxb6 22. g4. White has achieved his 'dream' position. Black hasthe bad bishop, and White's pieces have great squares on e4 and f5. Sowhy did Petrosian not go in for this? The reason is because he consideredthat White has few, if any, chances of winning from here, the main problembeing that bad bishops are very good defenders of weak pawns, whilst Whitehas no way to break through. Black sticks his king on e6 and waits. Evenif White gets his knight to fs and king to e4, Black just drops his bishopback to f8 and marks time with his king. In Petrosian's own words, 'winningsuch a position would be very, very difficult, if not impossible Instead,Petrosian chooses another plan entirely. Recognizing that Black's formallybad bishop is actually an effective defender of his weaknesses on f6 andh6, he exchanges it, so as to increase the vulnerability of these targets.","tags":["Tactical","Positional"],"event":"Great Endgames Series - Multi-piece Endings","annotator":"?","link":"http://gameknot.com/","slm_tag":"Positional","slm_score":5}

The version here, after 7.a4 Nc6 8.h3 e5 9.dxe5 dxe5 is the one that happens most frequently. White has not committed any of the minor pieces yet, so we need to reckon with various combinations of Be3, Bg5 and Bc4. White might also play Qc1 at some point, with Rd1 to follow. What are both sides playing for?The central pawn structure is symmetrical and the four Knights are placed well. The main difference is White's Bishop on e2 versus our Bishop on g7. White claims that their Bishop is easily activated with Bc4 which helps fight for control over the d5-square. On the other hand, our Bishop on g7 is staring at the e5-pawn, which looks like a more passive setup.White's argument is not wrong, but our Bishop is not that badly placed. White is playing for the square d5, we play for d4... and our Bishop often helps to support a Knight jump to d4 as we will see in some variations.What about our light-squared Bishop? We'd like to place it on e6, where is controls d5. White has played h3 so there is no other good option like ...Bg4. Speaking of h3, the move ...h6 is desirable for Black, too. The moves Bg5 or Ng5 in reply to ...Be6 are annoying and should be stopped. Finally, the square e7 is a good spot for the Queen, connecting the Rooks and allowing a Rook to d8.To summarize: our target setup is ...Be6, ...h6, ...Qe7, then probably a Rook to d8. Of course, White is moving in the meantime, and we need to adjust. Still, keep this setup in mind.White has several possible continuations now, and all the permutations of Be3/Bg5/Bc4 can be irritating at first. However, all the variations follow the same storyline: we try to achieve the target setup, while White tries to prevent it and gain control of d5.Before we look at some moves, we'd like to mention that Black scores very well in the dxe5 positions, even though White should not be worse. One reason might be that White is often not prepared for the ...a6 & ...Nc6 lines and seeks a simple solution. If you have never studied it, closing the centre with d4-d5 is not an easy decision. It leads to positions that are much more in the spirit of the Classical King's Indian, quite a long way from what a 1.e4-player usually gets on the board.We have seen that keeping the tension is unchallengeable, which leaves the dxe5 option. So frequently, White plays it as a 'cop out' with a somewhat weak mindset. We think this is the main reason for White's bad score, not the actual positions' quality.There are players on the White side that play these positions to press small advantages and grind us down. But don't think that White is after simplifications and a draw after the exchange; looks can be deceiving. However, there will be players (see White's lousy score) who view the trade on e5 as a way to avoid complications and simplify the game as much as possible. Against these players, it is crucial not to accept a draw readily but to continue playing and accumulating small advantages.A good strategy can be to offer trades that are favourable for us. If White is too keen on exchanging all pieces, these offers can be tempting. Even sterile positions often can be won by pure persistence - play on until they break down.","tags":["Tactical","Positional"],"event":"Pirc Defence. Classical 4.Nf3: Classical Variation 4.

Now that the queens are exchanged White need not any longer worry about any interference with his plans to queen the pawn except maneuvers of the black king, which might still lead to the capture or the blockade of the pawn. A rash advance of the pawn would again be the wrong thing. The right way of playing is indicated by a simple calculation. The pawn needs four moves to reach the queening square. But the black king arrives there in the same number of moves, so that he can capture the pawn the moment he queens. Consequently White will only be able to enforce the safe queening of his pawn if he can gain control of the queening square with his own king, thus protecting the pawn at the time of queening.Now, White needs three moves to bring his king up to his pawn on f4. In the meantime Black will have reached the square d6 and after White's Kf5 Black will block the further advance of White's king by ... Ke7. However, White can force Black to give the way free. The maneuver by which he does this is one which occurs in a similar form in nearly all pawn endings and its thorough grasp is therefore essential.

The reason must be that the Pb4-b5 of the minority attack is a means of breaking the half-open c-file fully open. But this is not the whole explanation. The essential point is that Black, who has the half-open e-file, cannot be so prompt with his counterattack. His thematic advance is ... Pf5-f4, and this need preparation. Preparation however needs time, and White can use this time to push forward his b-pawn without delay. In light of these considerations the difference between the present diagram and the normal QG positions, in which the minority attack has legitimate expectations of success, is clear enough.

Even in the exchange variation 3...a6 4.Bxc6, White's aim is not to win the e-pawn but rather to establish a healthy Kingside pawn majority, at the cost of the two Bishops. 4...dxc6 The punishment for grabbing on e5 is a swift equalization of the position: 5.Nxe5 Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2. Notice the resulting pawn structure. White and Black each have four pawns on the Queenside. In this kind of pawn formation, White cannot force a passed pawn: Black's "crippled" Queenside holds White's "healthy" set of four easily. So Black has the Bishop pair essentially for free. Unfortunately, it's almost inevitable that everything will be exchanged down the e-file (both sides will rush to occupy this with Rooks) with an early draw the likely result. So instead of playing 4.Bxc6 as a means of "winning" the e-pawn, White sometimes plays the exchange variation in order to trade his own d-pawn for Black's e-pawn. That is a different matter entirely: 5.0-0 Bd6 6.d4 exd4 7.Qxd4 This sort of position -- with or without the exchange of Queens -- affords White more winning chances. Now White's pawn majority is on the Kingside, and that makes a huge difference. Experience shows that Black's pair of Bishops is just about adequate compensation for White's pawn majority. But this line can definitely be played for something other than a stone-cold draw, as Fischer proved numerous times. Nevertheless, the resulting positions often lack the dynamism of a full-board struggle. In our game, Gligoric chooses a time-honored move that remains the main line of the Ruy Lopez: 4.Ba4 It's instructive to keep track of time in the opening. White is moving the Bishop for the second time, but this isn't really a net loss in development since Black's move ...a6 hardly counts for much in the way of time. White remains, then, half a tempo ahead. I can hear the faint sound of heads being scratched. "Half a tempo? How do you get half of a tempo? A move is a move, you can't have half of a move!" Not to leave you wondering, here's my modest contribution toward the theory of time in the opening. In the initial position of chess, White is thought to have a slight advantage. But why? The position is, after all, symmetrical. White's only advantage is that it is his turn to move. Now, it would violate logic if White, who has this theoretical advantage, were to stand worse after using it in the best possible way. Therefore, I propose to count having the turn to move as being worth half of a tempo. Consider: After 1.e4, White has moved -- and gets a full tempo for that. But it is now Black's turn to play, and so Black gets back half a tempo. The net difference? One half of a tempo, just as it was before White moved. Skip forward now to the point where White has played 4.Ba4. White has three useful moves on the board that affect, directly or indirectly, the center: P/e4, N/f3, B/a4 (threatening Black's Knight, though at the moment that threat doesn't carry much bite). Black has only two: N/c6 and P/e5. However, it is Black's turn to move. So White has retained his half-tempo lead. (White gets 3 tempi, one for each "good" move. Black gets two for "good" moves and another half-tempo for its being his turn to move.)","tags":["Tactical","Positional"],"event":"","annotator":"Tim McGrew","link":"Belgrade","slm_tag":"Positional","slm_score":5}

Qxc4 dxc4 18. c3/Rf1 ( either of the 2 will work imo ) Bb7 blackstands fine. I'd even go as far as to say that Black stands slightly betterdue to the possibility of the e-pawn becoming a passed pawn, the advantagein space on the queenside and the possibility of g4 becoming a very strongsquare for the knight on f6. Defending the f5 pawn will also make it sothat White won't have too many attacking opportunities anymore, givingthe initiative of the attack to black. Instead White should ignore thismove and probably play either Nd4, Ng3 or Nf4. Nd4 isn't too great becauseof the pin with Qb6. Ng3 and Nf4 accomplish the same thing, namely targetingthe weak h5 pawn, but Black has compensation for the pawn in terms of hisstrong queenside and actually capturing on h5 leads to quite a few complications.","tags":["Tactical","Positional"],"event":"Playing a blindfolded opponent - Full out war","annotator":"?","link":"http://gameknot.com/","slm_tag":"Positional","slm_score":5}

Secondly(and much more importantly), White is trading his good bishop for Black'sknight. Since White's pawn structure is locked down on the light squares,White's dark-colored bishop is much more valuable than his light-coloredbishop since it isn't blocked by his pawns.

White cannot mate immediately because of the pieces on the back rank, for example Rh4 mate is prevented by the bishop on d8. Likewise, the other pieces stop e3 mate, Qf5 mate and Nd5 mate. But the fact that each Black piece has a responsibility proves to be Black's undoing, because they can hardly move without stepping on each other's toes. After 1...Re7, for example, White can play 2 Rh4 mate, while 1...Re6 blocks the other bishop and allows 2 Nd5 mate. Indeed, in the diagram position Black has only two moves which cannot be met by immediate mate, namely 1...Bg5 and 1...Re3. If only White can find a way to prepare mates for these moves, then Black will be obliged to fatally weaken himself. What weakness is created by 1...Re3? The answer can only be that it blocks e3, and therefore the bishop on g1 is freed to deliver mate by Bh2. Thus the first move must be with the rook on h2, but should it move to h1 or h3? The answer is provided by the other possible defense, 1...Bg5. This blocks g5 and frees the queen to mate by Qh2. So the solution is the unlikely-looking 1 Rh1! There is no threat, but nevertheless Black has no defense.

It seems clear that White did not have the option of moving the Knightaway from the defense of f3 last move, and so developing with Re1 seemsbest, with the dangerous plan of Re1-e3-h3, for example, which is hardfor Black to meet. White needed to continue the slow buildup of an attackby mixing threats with prophylaxis as seen before. Still, while it seemsclear in hindsight that 26. Nxh7 is a mistake, it is hard to criticizea move that wins convincingly in all variations except for one improbablesacrifice. White was understandably eager to cash in on the strong attackingposition he had built up with patience and care, and in his position Iwould have hardly expected the tables to turn so quickly, either.","tags":["Tactical","Positional"],"event":"[R] Challenge from jestey1","annotator":"?","link":"http://gameknot.com/","slm_tag":"Positional","slm_score":5}

But when you have 2N versus 2B,the knights work together in ways that bishops can't duplicate. It becomesa more unbalanced game, with chances for both players.

This limits white's options.For example, as you rightly say, c5 followed by Ndf3 opens the bishop upagain, but this has allowed black counterplay in the center. The more immeditate11. Be3 prevents black from playing c5, thus solidifying white's controlof the center. White's had quite a bit of success with 11. Be3, where-as11 Nd2 seems drawish, giving away some of the momentary advantage thatwhite has built up in the center by allowing c5. Also note that allowingblack to play c5 has longer-term consequences. Black is heading for anend-game where he'd probably benefit from having two bishops (e.g. cxd4,Nxd4, NxN, cxN and black ends up with the two bishops). So, open diagonalshelp black. In allowing c5, white opens up the a5-e1 diagonal after exchangeson d4, giving black more space. Also, the pawn on d4 becomes an isolatedtarget, tying down some of white's minor pieces to keep an eye on protectingit... Perhaps a good way of looking at the position before 11. Nd2 or 11.Be3 is to ask the question, which of the central squares (d4, e4, d5 ande5) are in contention? White 'owns' e4 with his rook on e1, and black 'owns'd5 with his queen on d8, The white knight is sitting solidly on e5, butthe square in most contention is d4! (This is obvious after c5 has beenplayed, but the trick is to notice the possibility of c5 and the accompanyingcontention!) Moving the knight to d2 blocks white's queen support of thishotly contested square, while adding control to the already-solid e4 square.Thus, from my point of view it seems better to rather play Be3, focusingmore white muscle on d4.

Now you're DEFENDING a pawn you said yourself would be safeby the queen for a while?? That seems just as passive, if not more so,than white's move!' But in fact, there's much more to this move than that. I do not block the important c-pawn with my knight. Rather, I block thef-pawn, which probably shouldn't move immediately anyway (that weak diagonalcan kill many a good king if opened). I defend a pawn that's already defended,yes, but there's more to it than that. 1) I am one step closer to an earlykingside castle. If I play a moves like 3. e6 or 3. g6, followed by 4.Be7 (Bb4) or 4. Bg7, I could then castle at move 5. 2) In a strange way,I do need to defend my d5 pawn if I am to play a specific Queen's pawnopening. Consider 2....c5. If I try this reversed Queen's Gambit of sorts,I see I lose two pawns, and probably the game after 2...c5 3. dxc5 e5 4.Qxd5. It is clear that my d-pawn is not, in fact, defended sufficientlyin this course of play. 3) In an even stranger continuation that I sometimeslike to play as white, I am preparing e5 with this move. The idea therewould be to play at some point in some order c6, Nd7, e6, Bd6, and finallye5. This is very slow play and often times I opt for more active lines,but it is a powerful idea. If/when I force white to recapture on e5, myknight jumps powerfully into play and reveals, as black, my light-squarebishop. This is a perfectly fine idea. In any event, the merits ofthis move as compared to those of white's can be summed up as my knightbeing involved in a variety of possible plans, allowing a prompt castle,and not blocking my c-pawn.

Rd3? - I think I actually missed a chance to winthe game here, I think Rc2 would have probably prompted a white flag.

The file White controls leads to a dead end,his bishop is a target hemmed in by pawns, the Black king has found a safehaven on h7, the Black queen and knight have occupied footholds in theweak square complex (a4, c4, d3, e2, and f3), and the Black rook is readyto either join an attack on the White king from f6 or g6, or bring additionalpressure to bear on the queenside by swinging to a5 or b5 via f5 or g5. This adds up to a large advantage in mobility, one that will become obviousfrom the speed with which the Black pieces switch from queenside pressureto kingside attack. White's pieces will remain bottled up, with the rooknever escaping the 1st rank and the bishop escaping its box only to belost on d6.","tags":["Positional"],"event":"121W-07/Nov/2007","annotator":"?","link":"http://gameknot.com/","slm_tag":"Positional","slm_score":5}

I knew he was going to take my LSB, instead of protectinghis g7. This move looks good, but there is a draw back. After 12.Qxg7!,his position becomes weak, and that is why I decide to give away a freepiece. It appears that I made a bad choice and went wrong, but this sacwill become deflective, sooner or later. After I take his pawn, his kingis left in a vulnerable, and that is why my plan involved a trick withseveral aggressive moves. Afterall, this was my long term plan, and Iwanted to put him, in this type of position. FYI, I wanted to put himin this type of situation because I know that he is a very strong playerand was an Expert, at one point. Therefore, I was not going to mess aroundwith my plans. In other words, I was going to exceute my plans in chronologicalorder.","tags":["Positional"],"event":"Passive V.
